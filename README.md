Quasi-Typewriter
================

Quickstart
----------

First, get the index.html -- the icons and the webmanifest file are optional.

Second, open the html file in your browser.

Third, you can click the "i" in the upper right corner for more information, but
it'll probably be pretty self-explanitory.


Why?
----

Really, this project is about seeing if a few of the attributes of a typewriter
(quasi-permanence, zero demands and requests for attention, and generating
physical artifacts of your work, but leaving no trace otherwise) are useful in
a digital context -- at least to the best ability of a digital environment to
reproduce any of those.

First, this app is meant for *writing* not editing. It doesn't replace any
characters you type or suggest different words, or alert you to how
terrible your spelling and grammar is. It doesn't even demand you adhere to some
ideological structure or format, and certainly doesn't *change* the characters
you type into something else.

It silently waits for your direction, and makes no judgement about what you
have or have not done.

It gives you space to type, allows you to edit the line you're on, but
then asks you to *commit* to the text you've written, at least as long as the
page exists.

Second, this app doesn't store anything or track anything. If you want to keep
what you write, then you have to print it, or highlight and copy/paste it
yourself.

It doesn't care how many times you type the letter 't' or click the mouse
button. It doesn't generate a heat map for the most used parts of the page.

It doesn't require permission to be used, or data to be stored, or files to
be synced, or anything to be registered or licensed.


How do you use it?
------------------

Well, open the page, click on the ribbon, then start typing. Hit enter. Repeat.

When no more characters will fit on a line, you won't be able to add any.

When no more lines can fit on a page, you won't be able to add any.

Then print the page -- to pdf, to paper, to whatever. Or copy/paste the text.
That's up to you.

cmd-f (or ctrl-f) will request full screen, and drop away all UI if the browser
allows it.

And that's it.


TODO
----

- [ ] verticle center mark on left or right side of sheet like on the
      ribbon might be a good visual guide. might be too much too, should experiment
